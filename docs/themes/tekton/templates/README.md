This directory includes the templates for dynamically generated pages,
such as the documentation vault and the version switcher.

At this moment the templates here are used to support the versioning of
Tekton documentation, as the built-in system does not apply well to the
structure of the Tekton project. The templates here are used by the scripts
in `../sync`.
